# Global-Mental-Health-Analysis

**Project Type:** Data Analysis
**Group Members:** Nicole Choi (nhc35) and Grace Wang (gzw2)
**Course Code:** 4741

In order to better address the concern of mental health, our group has decided to use the “Global Mental Health Disorders” on kaggle to understand the influences of global events on mental health and why that might be the case. We will be incorporating events, like natural disasters or wars, to see how it may cause or help with disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, etc. We would like to discuss our vision for this project with you.
